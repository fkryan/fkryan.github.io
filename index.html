          <h2>Hi, I'm Fiona.</h2>
          <p>I am a first year Computer Science PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am advised by Professor James Rehg within the School of Interactive Computing. 
              My research interests are in computer vision &amp; perception, with applications to healthcare and understanding human behavior.
          </p>
          <p>I graduated from Indiana University in 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.M. in Clarinet Performance. 
              At IU, I did research in the Music Informatics Lab and Computer Vision Lab. 
              I also spent 2 summers interning at Google, where I worked on deep learning for diagnosing skin conditions and scene understanding for Nest Cams.
