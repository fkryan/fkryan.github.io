               <h2>Hi, I'm Fiona.</h2>
               <p>I am a second year Computer Science PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am advised by Professor James Rehg within the School of Interactive Computing. 
                  My research interests are in computer vision &amp; perception, with applications to understanding social behavior and behavioral health indicators. I am excited about developing video
                  recognition models that understand people and the way they interact with each other and the 3D world around them.
               </p>
               <p>I graduated from Indiana University in 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.M. in Clarinet Performance. 
                  At IU, I did research in the Music Informatics Lab and Computer Vision Lab. 
                  I also spent 2 summers interning at Google, where I worked on deep learning for diagnosing skin conditions and scene understanding for Nest Cams.

         <h2>Research</h2>
         <h3>Modeling Social Behavior</h3>
         <p>How can we make AI socially intelligent? I am investigating deep learning methods for modeling aspects of social behavior including gaze, attention, and gesture. I'm especially excited about applications of this work to behavioral health and understanding autism.</p>
         <h3>Musical Score Following</h3>
         <p>Score alignment algorithms work well for a straightforward performance of a piece, but realistic music practice involves repetition, mistakes, and skips! Our team created an efficient offline score following algorithm to model realistic, nonconsecutive musical practice. See our <a href="http://smc2019.uma.es/articles/S6/S6_02_SMC2019_paper.pdf">paper</a> from Sound & Music Computing Conference 2019. </p>
